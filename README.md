## Another [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html) Mod Manager

This project is an alternative to the [Slipstream Mod Manager](https://github.com/Vhati/Slipstream-Mod-Manager), written in Rust and with some additional features.

### Features

- [x] Regular FTL mods (Slipstream compatible¹)
- [x] Supports mod tags from [Blizz's Slipstream fork](https://github.com/blizzarchon/Slipstream-Mod-Manager)
- [x] Supports an ftlman-specific Lua patching API (documentation available [here](https://fishhh.dev/ftlman/lua.html))
- [x] Automatic [Hyperspace](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace) installer
- [x] Functional² XML and Lua Sandbox (syntax highlighting, WIP diagnostics)

Currently automatic hyperspace installation is supported for the following FTL versions:
- Steam (Linux and Windows)
- Epic
- Origin (untested)

Patching the Microsoft version is technically supported but you may encounter permission problems if you try to patch it in the original installation directory.

If you find a mod that fails to patch with ftlman but works with slipstream or one that works different under ftlman [open an issue](https://github.com/afishhh/ftlman/issues/new).

¹ ftlman's XML parser is modeled closely after FTL's (RapidXML). This means it is very lenient but behaviour may be slightly different than Slipstream, due to Slipstream's messy handling of sloppy parsing.<br>
² Struggles with files hundreds of kilobytes in size.

### Installation

#### Pre-built binaries

**This is the recommended method of installation.**

Pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS and Windows are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/afishhh/ftlman/releases) tab.

##### Setup

1. Extract the `ftlman` directory from the archive into your FTL directory (or wherever you want, it doesn't matter).
2. If your FTL installation is currently in a modded state, revert it to vanilla before patching with ftlman. If you used Slipstream before, this can be accomplished by opening Slipstream, unchecking all mods, and patching with Slipstream.
3. (optional) Before you first run the executable you can move over everything inside your Slipstream `mods` directory into the `ftlman/mods` directory and your mod order will be automatically migrated.
4. If you use Steam your FTL installation directory should be automatically detected, if not you need to click on "Settings" and then copy the path to your FTL installation directory into the text box labelled "FTL data directory".

#### Compiling from source

Compilation requires a **nightly** Rust toolchain due to questionable design decisions I made in [silpkg](https://github.com/afishhh/silpkg).
For instructions on installing Rust go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install, make sure to select the nightly toolchain release during installation.

After installing Rust, open a terminal then execute the following command:
```command
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/afishhh/ftlman ftlman
```

> [!NOTE]
> The same command can be used to update the program.

You should then be able to run `ftlman` in a terminal to start the program.

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions also apply to Windows users, just replace terminal with `cmd.exe`.

#### NixOS with flakes

Add this repository to your flake inputs and then use the default package output.

```nix
{
  # ... other inputs ...
  inputs.ftlman.url = "github:afishhh/ftlman";
  # Optionally reuse top-level nixpkgs
  # inputs.ftlman.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

  outputs = { self, ftlman, ... }:
    let
      package = ftlman.packages.${system}.default;
    in {
      # use package
    };
}
```

You can also try out the program using `nix run`:

```command
nix run github:afishhh/ftlman
```
